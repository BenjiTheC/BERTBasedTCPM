# BERT-based NN TopCoder Pricing Model

> This is the repo for Benjamin's research thesis

The previous repo containing other models are too messy to manage - That's what happened when you have no idea about a data analysis research

So instead of making the original repo messier, I created a new repo to singly focus on builing the pricing model using BERT and Neural Network. There are several parts to builde the pricing model:

1. Fine-tune bert with my requirement text
2. Customize network and append meta data features in the BERT last layer states
3. Train the model for a classification task

I will have some code/data copy-paste from the [previous repo](https://github.com/BenjiTheC/TopCoderDataAnalysis.git) to save my time.
